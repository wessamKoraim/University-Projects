Some simple ways of making this a bit faster:
* Precompute inverses of X and Y into double4_t variables to avoid divisions in the innermost loops.
* Sum a and b using vector arithmetic, then extract components from the sum, instead of summing components of a and b separately.

There might be an easier way of using OpenMP thread local variables, compared to this:
    Helper[len_y - 1].r = LoopResult;
    Helper[len_y - 1].h = tmp;
In addition to the extra space usage, it is rather easy to accidentally introduce a data race by getting one index wrong.
Please see the first example on this page:
