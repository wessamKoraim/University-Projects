-1

There is very little vectorization in the code: you are reading scalars from memory, and doing scalar multiplications. Only additions are vectorized. You should allocate an array of 'double4_t' vectors and pack the normalized data in these vectors. Then in the performance-critical part you would read vectors, do vector multiplication, and do vector addition.
