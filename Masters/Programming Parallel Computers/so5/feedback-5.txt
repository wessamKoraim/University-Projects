Looks good!

You could consider doing a three-way partition and skipping the middle partition where all values are equal to the pivot.
This will speed up the test cases where input contains a lot of duplicates.

In C++, the preferred way of generating pseudo-random numbers is using functions from <random> instead of the cstdlib rand-function.
