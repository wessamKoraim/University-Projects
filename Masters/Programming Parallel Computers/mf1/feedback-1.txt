Looks good!

Some notes on how to get the running time below 4.5 seconds:

The main issue that affects performance here is that the memory for storing elements in 'values' is allocated separately for each element every time you push an element onto the vector.
Since you know the precise size of the window (you can compute it from Left, Right, Upper, and Lower), it is possible to allocate space for the whole window in one go.
There are many ways to do this, but by adding one call to reserve in the function Median, I got your solution running in 4.15573 s.

See e.g.
* https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector/vector, vector constructors
* https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector/reserve, allocating space for a constructed vector without changing its size
