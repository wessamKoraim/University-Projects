**Objective:** Get a first feel of I/O-streams in C++, and test that
  your programming environment works.

Implement function **Hello()** that outputs `Hello world!`, followed by
a newline. You should not use the *printf()* call as in C, but instead
C++ streams and functions that are defined in C++ "iostream" header.
