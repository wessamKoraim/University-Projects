**Objective:** Learn how to write a class definition.

In this task you will write the class definition for a **Person** class. You
have been provided with a main function that does not compile in the initial
state, because the class does not yet exist.

The Person class has two attributes: **Name** of the person, and the
**birthyear** of the person. In addition, there are two class functions to
be implemented: **GetName** that returns the name, and **GetAge** that takes the 
current year as an argument and returns the current age of the person. When
everything works properly, the program should output:

    Kalle Kankkunen is 22 years old.
    Ville Vinkkunen is 26 years old.
    Liisi Pirinen is 68 years old.
