**Objective:** Get familiar with basic use of classes and methods,
learning to implement your own simple classes based on a given class
definition.

In this task you will implement a full class handling a bank account,
starting from constructor, along with a few functions for accessing
the class content and operating it. There is also one function outside
the class, *Transfer*, that will transfer money between two bank
accounts.

Read file *bank_account.hpp* carefully, there are comments on each
class member describing what the function should do, and based on the
comments you should write your implementation in *bank_account.cpp*
